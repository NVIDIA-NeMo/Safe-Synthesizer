## Description: <br>
Use NeMo Safe Synthesizer through task-specific routing: running the CLI or SDK, configuring parameters, troubleshooting runtime failures, inspecting artifacts, and interpreting evaluation outputs. <br>

This skill is ready for commercial/non-commercial use. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache 2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and data engineers use this skill to have an agent help them run, configure, troubleshoot, and inspect outputs from NeMo Safe Synthesizer, including CLI/SDK pipeline runs, differential privacy settings, config overrides, generation and OOM failures, artifacts, logs, and evaluation metrics. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [Optional] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [API key] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- Claude Code (`aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-5-5`) <br>
- Codex (`openai/openai/gpt-6.1-sol`) <br>



## Evaluation Tasks: <br>
6 evaluation tasks (4 positive, 2 negative); 1 attempt per task, each run in its own isolated sandbox pod (`k8s-sandbox`). Evaluated 2026-11-10 with evaluator version `1.6.9`; baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. <br>

## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Is it safe to use? Scored from `security` (100%). <br>
- Correctness: Is the answer correct? Scored from `accuracy` (100%). <br>
- Discoverability: Was the right skill loaded when needed? Scored from `skill_execution` (100%). <br>
- Effectiveness: Did the skill help complete the task? Scored from `goal_accuracy` (50%) + `behavior_check` (50%). <br>
- Efficiency: Did it avoid wasted tool calls and token usage? Scored from `skill_efficiency` (50%) + `token_efficiency` (50%). <br>

Underlying evaluation signals used in this run: <br>
- `security`: Security: unsafe operations, secret leakage, and unauthorized access. <br>
- `skill_execution`: Skill Execution: whether the expected skill was selected, decoys were avoided, and the workflow executed. <br>
- `skill_efficiency`: Tool Productivity: tool-call productivity (legacy wire id; routing is scored under Discoverability). <br>
- `accuracy`: Accuracy: final-answer correctness against the reference answer. <br>
- `goal_accuracy`: Goal Accuracy: whether the user's goal was achieved. <br>
- `behavior_check`: Behavior Check: whether the expected workflow behavior was followed. <br>
- `token_efficiency`: Token Efficiency: actual uncached prompt plus completion usage (50% of Efficiency). <br>

### Results at a Glance

| Measure | Claude Code (Baseline → Skill Uplift) | Codex (Baseline → Skill Uplift) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Overall | 91.9% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 89.1% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Security | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) | 100.0% → 100.0% (±0.0 points) |
| Correctness | 53.3% → 96.7% (+43.4 points) | 80.0% → 96.7% (+16.7 points) |
| Discoverability | 100.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 95.0% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |
| Effectiveness | 37.1% → 86.9% (+49.8 points) | 69.3% → 80.8% (+11.5 points) |
| Efficiency | 75.8% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable | 73.3% — baseline ran, but no comparable score was available; uplift unavailable |

**How to read this table:** baseline is the same task attempted without the target skill. Scores are rounded to one decimal; threshold-adjacent values use additional precision so their displayed band matches the verdict. Uplift is derived from those displayed scores and shown in percentage points.

Example: `47.0% → 92.0% (+45.0 points)` means the skill-assisted run scored 92.0%, 45.0 percentage points above its 47.0% no-skill baseline.

A partial dimension was calculated from only the available configured signals; review the detailed report before relying on it.

#### Comparison details

Shared-source comparisons use the same signals and weights on both conditions. They do not replace the full dimension scores above or change the publication verdict.

| Agent | Dimension | Basis | Baseline → With skill (uplift) | Explanation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| claude-code | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| claude-code | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 96.2% → 97.9% (+1.7 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |
| codex | Discoverability | Dimension comparison | N/A | Discoverability is not applicable to the no-skill baseline; there is no installed skill to discover. |
| codex | Efficiency | Token-only comparison | 91.3% → 89.9% (-1.4 points) | Only Token Efficiency is comparable; the full dimension scores use different evaluator sources. |
